Restatement of the aim or method	in regards to the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was compared to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were invited to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	to conduct the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	error of approximation	5
Restatement of the aim or method	in the second step of the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	thus we decided to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were divided into four	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we first calculated the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	this approach allowed us to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was conducted to analyze the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was carried out to determine	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were converted to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was done for the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was carried out by	5
Restatement of the aim or method	only one of the two	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we decided not to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was set to 005	5
Restatement of the aim or method	to provide an	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we extracted the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we therefore used a	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we included in the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	first we conducted	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we created two	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we therefore used	5
Restatement of the aim or method	also included the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	with the help of the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	before and after each	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was calculated to predict	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was conducted in two	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was also used in	5
Restatement of the aim or method	to examine the * we conducted a	5
Restatement of the aim or method	should be significantly	5
Restatement of the aim or method	variable in the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was measured by the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	then we examined the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was performed to determine whether	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were classified into	5
Restatement of the aim or method	extracted from the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	used to test the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were calculated using the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was conducted to test for	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was tested for the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was set at	5
Restatement of the aim or method	ratings of each	5
Restatement of the aim or method	could account for the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were compared using a	5
Restatement of the aim or method	within each of the three	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was chosen based on	5
Restatement of the aim or method	in addition in order to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	with the help of	5
Restatement of the aim or method	the direct path from	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were conducted to determine the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	was calculated by	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we further examined whether the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were added as a	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were included in the current	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we examined how	5
Restatement of the aim or method	representative of the	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were created for each	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were compared in terms of	5
Restatement of the aim or method	were compared on their	5
Restatement of the aim or method	finally we conducted an	5
Restatement of the aim or method	which allowed us to	5
Restatement of the aim or method	that did not include	5
Restatement of the aim or method	to determine how	5
Restatement of the aim or method	from the remaining	5
Restatement of the aim or method	we chose the term	5
Restatement of the aim or method	with the no camera present	5
Restatement of the aim or method	ability across different	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in order to address this	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were coded for	4
Restatement of the aim or method	to see whether	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we were also	4
Restatement of the aim or method	they were excluded from the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we decided to use the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	by looking at the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	the focus of the current	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in order to exclude	4
Restatement of the aim or method	across the 10	4
Restatement of the aim or method	from the start of the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we only included the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	of the first and the second	4
Restatement of the aim or method	allowed us to obtain	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we conducted an additional	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we created a new	4
Restatement of the aim or method	is considered to be	4
Restatement of the aim or method	first we ran a	4

Restatement of the aim or method	were those that elicited	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in order to ensure that	4
Restatement of the aim or method	the first of these	4
Restatement of the aim or method	with a 2	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were submitted to a repeated	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we adopted a	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we used a 2 2	4
Restatement of the aim or method	was driven by the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in order to have	4
Restatement of the aim or method	to all of the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in addition we conducted	4
Restatement of the aim or method	using a 2 3	4
Restatement of the aim or method	using a 2 2 repeated	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were obtained for each	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were conducted at the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were restricted to the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	to which the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	with the ratings of	4
Restatement of the aim or method	was calculated on	4
Restatement of the aim or method	was calculated with the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were also carried out	4
Restatement of the aim or method	between the mean	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in order to obtain a	4
Restatement of the aim or method	a 2 2 repeated	4
Restatement of the aim or method	out of the total number of	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were performed on these	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were examined between	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were divided in two	4
Restatement of the aim or method	and examined the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	was to determine if	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were examined to	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were defined as the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we carried out a separate	4
Restatement of the aim or method	enabled us to	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we conducted a two	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we conducted a * in which the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we applied the same	4
Restatement of the aim or method	was specified as	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in which we	4
Restatement of the aim or method	was used to compute	4
Restatement of the aim or method	divided by the number of	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were not included in these	4
Restatement of the aim or method	would be more	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in a given	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we addressed this	4
Restatement of the aim or method	next we looked at	4
Restatement of the aim or method	an index of	4
Restatement of the aim or method	in order to explain the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were compared on	4
Restatement of the aim or method	by comparing the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	has been used to	4
Restatement of the aim or method	on different types of	4
Restatement of the aim or method	take into account the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	between 0 and 1	4
Restatement of the aim or method	relative to a	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we also explored whether	4
Restatement of the aim or method	we also asked whether the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were also excluded from the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	to test for possible	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were performed separately for each	4
Restatement of the aim or method	means of the	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were excluded from all	4
Restatement of the aim or method	therefore the final	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were obtained using	4
Restatement of the aim or method	were conducted on these	4
Restatement of the aim or method	recorded during the	4
